# Karmatical's TextBlocks

A text-based project editor for Scratch projects.

This project is inspired by (but is **not** a fork of) the original **Tosh Editor** ([GitHub](https://github.com/tjvr/tosh2/), [Website](https://tosh.blob.codes/app/)). Tosh currently only supports the older SB2 format and has not been updated in several years, which prompted me to develop a modern alternative.

This project is **open-source** and supports custom **Javascript-based Addons** (equivalent to Extensions).
