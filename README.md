# Karmatical's TextBlocks

A text-based project editor for Scratch projects.

This project is inspired by (but is **not** a fork of) the original **Tosh Editor** ([GitHub](https://github.com/tjvr/tosh2/), [Website](https://tosh.blob.codes/app/)). Tosh currently only supports the older SB2 format and has not been updated in several years, which prompted me to develop a modern alternative.

This project is **open-source** and has basic support for custom Addons (equivalent to Extensions).

* Support for **Legacy Scratch 2.0 (SB2) Format**.
* Integration with **Turbowarp** Extensions.
* Dedicated **Desktop Application** (Currently runs only on GitPages Web Version).
* Support **Cloud Variables** (Currently, Cloud variables only work when the project is exported).
